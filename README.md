# XHP-LIB

Forked from https://github.com/facebook/xhp-lib/tree/1205aad1045912c4ccb747b297f0093a4196c202 by Facebook Inc.

This is a community maintained fork of xhp-lib/php-lib focused on non-hack syntax.  It is meant to be used with https://github.com/phplang/xhp on PHP.  Users of HHVM should install the official xhp-lib at https://github.com/facebook/xhp-lib which has full hack type checker support.
